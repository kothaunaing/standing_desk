      <h1>About Standing Desks</h1>
      <p>
        A standing desk is a kind of desk that allows you to stand up while working. Many new desks allow you to change
        the height, so you can sit or stand when you want. These desks are called height-adjustable desks or sit-stand
        desks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research is still new, but using standing desks can be very good for your health and help you work better. At
        least, using standing desks can help reduce some of the bad effects of sitting too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following are some of the <b><i>health benefits</i></b> of using standing desks.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Standing Desks Can Help Prevent Weight Gain</h2>
          <p>
            Standing instead of sitting can help burn more calories that can reduce the risk of weight gain and obesity.
            Standing for an afternoon burns up to 170 calories, which is 1,000 calories per week in total.
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Standing Desks Can Help Lower Blood Sugar Levels </h2>
          <p>
            Standing after meals can reduce sugar spikes, which is good for people with type 2 diabets. In one of the
            studies, standing for 180 minutes after lunch reduced blood sugar spikes by 43% compared to sitting.
          </p>

          <p class="testimonial">
            Studies show that using a standing desk at work can lower blood sugar levels, especially after lunch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Standing Desks Can Reduce Back Pain</h2>
          <p>
            Long hours of sitting can lead to back pain, especially in the lower back. Studies show that using a
            standing desk can reduce chronic back pain. For example, one study found that participants who used standing
            desks for a few weeks reported a 32% reduction in lower back pain.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Standing Desks May Improve Mood and Energy Levels</h2>
          <p>
            Long hours of sitting can lead to back pain, especially in the lower back. Studies show that using a
            standing desk can reduce chronic back pain. For example, one study found that participants who used standing
            desks for a few weeks reported a 32% reduction in lower back pain.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Standing Desks May Lower the Risk of Heart Disease</h2>
          <p>
            Sitting for long periods has been linked to heart disease. Studies suggest that standing instead of sitting
            may help lower this risk. Research shows that prolonged sitting can increase the risk of heart disease by up
            to 147%, so using a standing desk may contribute to better heart health.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Standing Desks Can Boost Productivity</h2>
          <p>
            Alternating between sitting and standing may help increase productivity. Standing desks can improve focus,
            energy, and engagement, which can be helpful for tasks requiring attention. Some studies found that people
            using standing desks showed improved productivity over time without affecting work accuracy.
